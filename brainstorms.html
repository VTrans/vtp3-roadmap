    <h1>Day 1</h1>

      <h2>Morning Brainstorm</h2>

      <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tie "Why" into every answer we give</li>
            <ul>
              <li>For example, give a high-level explanation of pavement treatment decisions along with the assessment.</li>

            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Wish-list</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Automated Answers via mailing list</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Public fills out problem about an asset</li>
              <li>Email auto-responder about how we make decisions about fixing the asset</li>
              <li>Have a brief bullet list at the top with a brief explanation</li>
              <li>Have a little more detailed explanation below</li>
              <li>If they're still concerned then they can click to email the appropriate person</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <strong>Plow tracking Route priority map</strong>

        <strong>Anything that can improve VPINS</strong>

        <strong>Tie project updates into GoVT - updates about your commute</strong>
        <strong>Tie construction, detours into Google Maps</strong>

        <h3>Pavement</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>My road is in terrible condition. When did you last do work here?</li>
            <li>What is the actual condition?</li>
            <li>When will it next be paved?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Why do we do what we do?</p>

        <h3>Bridge</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Shutdown\Detour clearly defined\displayed\warned in advance</li>
            <li>Construction</li>
            <li>Structurally deficient</li>
            <li>NBI - how we rate - UVM</li>
            <li>"Town Short vs Town Long vs UltraShort" -> just bridges</li>
            <li>What is the user story for bridge condition? Is it necessary? linked to customers experience?</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>OPS Top 10</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Trying to get districts back to doing maintenance instead of mini projects.</li>
            <li>Ditching Culvert Guardrails Mowing Litter Tree Trimming Plowing</li>
            <li>Show the public a regional picture of activities at a district level - aggregate stats. "We're doing things"</li>
            <li>Accomplishments: How many plug joints, how many bridges washed Mimic Filkorn's fact sheet to legislature</li>
            <li>Also have asset stats - how many culverts per district - emergency summary</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This sounds like a great place for d3.js</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Why do we do what we do regarding (winter) maintenance?</li>
            <li>Ex: Litter picking - where and how much</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Capital Projects</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>What are capital projects</li>
            <li>"What is the status of a particular project?"</li>
            <li>What do we map?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>VPINS</li>
              <li>Maintenance projects</li>
            </ul>
            <li>They will ask us for planned maintenance projects</li>
            <ul>
              <li>From the public's perspective, a large culvert repair isn't different than a project</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Things we can't map go into a report</li>
            <li>What do we share?</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Construction year (next 3 years)</li>
              <li>What projects are going to start THIS MONTH? (time slider option)</li>
              <li>Get emails when a project in your area or on your commute</li>       
            </ul>          
            <li>Where When (Start-end) Type Info - description Point of Contact - one person "Project Manager"</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Who do I call?</h3>
          <p>WHY do people call?</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Maintenance</li>
            <li>Construction</li>
          </ul>

            <li>Maintenance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>How do we direct them? Click a point, buffer around it, who do they call? Show a blank map with just some simple polygons</p>

      <strong>We probably don't want to go with AGOL so we have a more flexible platform. The very best AGOL homepage doesn't quite meet our needs.</strong>

      <h3>What is GitHub</h3>
        <a href="http://vtrans.github.io/vtp3-what-is-github" target="_blank">Link to Presentation</a>

      <h3>Github Concerns</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Spend too much time worrying about GitHub and lose track of the goals</li>
          <li>It's more geared towards technical programming</li>
        </ol>
      
      <h3 id="github-benefits">GitHub Benefits</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>We might not have to use it so much</li>
          <li>One-stop documentation</li>
          <li>For the future</li>
        </ol> 

    <h1>Day 2</h1>
      <h3>Steering Committee</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Filkorn: SeeClickFix. I get questions about mowing a lot, and potholes</li>
          <li>Viani: We don't have maintenance plan info, just what has passed</li>
          <li>Nailor: This is a parking lot issue for the future - send it to Ops for consideration in the future. You can plan on rolling out a maintenance plan in the future</li>
          <li>Marshia: If you can't do it now then don't. You don't have the info now.</li>
          <li>Allen: This is kind of an internal performance measures</li>
          <li>Marshia: Projects in VPINS will be mapped - OK. Maybe future large maintenance projects will be in VPINS</li>
          <li>Nailor: Don't build a system around another data source - it will remove the impetus of OPS to build a sustainable database system</li>
          <li>Filkorn: Leveling? - not included at the moment - should be? Give specific recommendations to program managers for how they can be included - change their behavior</li>
          <li>Allen: Track threats and opportunities</li>
          <li>511 vs VTP3 - there are many versions of the message right now</li>
          <li>Filkorn: If THIS system is consistent, maybe it becomes centralized</li>
          <li>Nailor: Identifying the "system of record" that carries the offical word</li>
        </ul>

      <h3 id="top-achievements">Top Achievements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Matt mocked up the framework for the home page</li>
          <li>Evan got a long ways on the contacts map</li>
          <li>Stephen made <a href="http://vtrans.github.io/vtp3-roadmap/">this</a> for showing the daily work and discussion summaries</li>
          <li>Reid worked on importing historic projects into dTIMS to overlay with condition sectioning (with some struggle with new dtims product)</li>
          <li>Kevin worked with DBA and devlopers to build a VPINS project view on the GIS database.  Afternoon was spent automating the projects info to geometry</li>
        </ul>

      <h1>Day 3</h1>
        <h3>Steering Committee</h3>
          <p>7:30</p>
          <p>Per Nailor:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Have the header of the popup mirror what people would want.
            </li>
            <li>"If you are curious about construction in this area, call:" </li>
            <li>"If you have a question about how this road is maintained, call:" </li>
            <li>"If you work for a municipality and have questions about this road, call:" </li>
            <li>Then send to Filkorn for comment</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Scott: Should we include email addresses? Work with Bean and Craver to figure out why the Ops emails aren't in the ref table</p>
          
          <p>Allen: When click, drop-down box with 3 pop-ups?</p>
          
          <p>Matt: Link as query string to open data portal</p>
          
          <p>Viani: What are the themes for the homepage bins? The popout box should have a common theme</p>
          
          <p>The top level shows a picture and title of the theme, then the popout will contain links to the different places</p>
          
          <p>Scott: All data in GDB_VTrans is publishable under AGO ODP</p>
          
          <p>8:15</p>
        
        <h3>Top Achievements</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Matt rebuilt the VTransparency homepage from scratch</li>
            <li>Evan built out the geoprocess script to create the contacts data</li>
            <li>Stephen built out the Open Data Portal</li>
            <li>Reid finished and published the 2013 pavement condition data</li>
            <li>Kevin continued working on the projects processing scripts</li>
          </ul>

      <h1>Day 4</h1>
        <h3>Steering Committee</h3>
          <p>7:30</p>
          <p>New website - great!</p>
          <p>Open data portal - Great! </p>
          <p>Marshia: Who is this for? You lost me between the home page and the data site</p>
          <p>Nailor: Pushing the data out to the open data portal wasn't a primary goal of this effort, but is an unintended benefit of this process </p>
          <p>Pavement data - linking to the latest pavement projects is great.</p>
          <p>Nailor: Can you show the town and route on the pavement map?</p>
          <p>Scott: Why the OSM basemap?</p>
          <p>Scott: Why routing?</p>
          <p>Marshia: Show the routing.</p>
          <p>Allen: Can you use the route as a selection set to display the condition of your routing?</p>
          <p>Contact Map - popups have questions at the top</p>
          <p>Most of the data was automated, but lacking info on email address for district contacts. Might not be sustainable.</p>
          <p>Can it be from MATS?</p>
          <p>Filkorn: We update the website manually</p>
          <p>Nailor: Note down the issue so we can research a solution later.</p>
          <p>Filkorn: How can we develop consistency across the agency. How can we simplify </p>
          <p>Marshia: Caputring a comprehensive parking lot is critical to the future. Things we highlight here for the future will be major targets for the agency. Not just "This is awesome" - "These are the things we know we should do. Force the agency to address the issues brought up. Prioritize them"</p>
          <p>Viani: Bridges? Do we need condition?</p>
          <p>Nailor: national interest in strucutral defficiency sometimes drive it</p>
          <p>Scott: towns ask about bridges - summary reports, data etc from Thurber.</p>
          <p>Filkorn: Where are the bridge inspection reports?</p>
          <p>Marshia: The report is - "We want to show bridges, but we don't know how to display it" for discussion on Monday</p>
          <p>Filkorn: Load limits would be dreamy. We get asked about load postings all the time. Different than the individual route permit</p>
          <p>Nailor: List bridge restrictions relevant to the public</p>
          <p>Allen: Get the more detailed information available too for analysis</p>
          <p>Scott: Restricted crane movement map was valuable. </p>
          <hr>
        <h3>Data support meeting</h3>
          <p>Projects issue - be sure to bring up Monday so Marshia can put the pressure on to get project managers to input early start date</p>
          <p>Contacts issue - there is not a good source of information </p>
          <p>9:00 am</p>
