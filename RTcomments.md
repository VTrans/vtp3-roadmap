##Thoughts for the next process

•	For future sessions look into bringing Uplan II cohorts from other states into the room with you. Possibly AASHTO Innovation Initiative would have paid to have someone from PennDOT here with you all week or part of the week. At a minimum dial them in a few times a week via web. Share our challenges and successes along the way.

•	What is the process for administering future queries and enhancements to the system, understanding if/when this is successful “They will come!” If we can’t evolve and at a rate the customer expects the effort may lose momentum.

##Data considerations

•	What about the ROW data? Not needed this generation, down the road the public needs to gain access to what Nina is developing.

•	Where are all the Commercial and Private Access Permits? Make paperwork viewable and printable. How many applications are pending? 

•	Where have black bear been crossing the state highways?

•	What is the average cost of Snow & Ice Control per mile along a segment of highway? Possibly heat map by cost, sensitive to color blindness of course.

##Can we fit into 3.0

•	Allow a legislator to view the map by their respective legislative boundaries and answer their questions, like, “What is going to be under construction this coming summer?” The annual Town Meeting Day query to the Agency.

•	Make the data queried easily printable. Customers likely will want to print off their findings and carry around with them to show friends, relatives, co-workers, and constituents.

•	How long has my pavement been Very Poor?

•	Show what was the last treatment in the Pavement Condition information box.
