##Struggle #1: Getting people to use it

Tie the "Why" into every answer we give

###Pavement

- My road is in terrible condition. When did you last do work here?
- What is the actual condition?
- When will it next be paved?

Concept:
Why we do what we do?
  - Public fills out public problem 
  - Email auto-responder about how we decide - this may answer many questions
  - Have a little more detailed explanation below
  - Then they respond if they are still concerned - goes to district personnel

###Bridge
  - Shutdown\Detour clearly defined/displayed warned in advance
  - Construction
  - Structurally deficient
  - NBI - how we rate
  - "Town Short vs Town Long vs UltraShort" -> just bridges


Anything that can improve VPINS is a great goal
