Filkorn: SeeClickFix. I get questions about mowing a lot, and potholes

KV: We don't have maintenance plan info, just what has passed.

Filkorn: SeeClickFix

Nailor: This is a parking lot issue for the future - send it to Ops for consideration in the future. You can plan on rolling out a maintenance plan in the future 

Marshia: If you can't do it now then don't. You don't have the info now.

Allen: This is kind of an internal performance measures

Marshia: Projects in VPINS will be mapped - OK. Maybe future large maintenance projects will be in VPINS

Nailor: Don't build a system around another data source - it will remove the impetus of OPS to build a sustainable database system

Filkorn: Leveling? - not included at the moment - should be? Give specific recomendations to program managers for how they can be included - change their behavior

Allen: Track threats and opportunities

511 vs VTP3 - there are many versions of the message right now

Filkorn: If THIS system is consistent, maybe it becomes centralized

Nailor: Identifying the "system of record" that carries the offical word

Per Nailor:

Have the header of the popup mirror what people would want.

"If you are curious about construction in this area, call:"
"If you have a question about how this road is maintained, call:"
"If you work for a municipality and have questions about this road, call:"
Then send to Filkorn for comment

Scott: Should we include email addresses? Work with Bean and Craver to figure out why the Ops emails aren't in the ref table

Allen: When click, drop-down box with 3 pop-ups?


Matt:

Link as query string to open data portal

Viani: 

What are the themes for the homepage bins? The popout box should have a common theme

The top level shows a picture and title of the theme, then the popout will contain links to the different places
