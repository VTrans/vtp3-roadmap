#Day 2

7:45

Filkorn: SeeClickFix. I get questions about mowing a lot, and potholes

KV: We don't have maintenance plan info, just what has passed.

Filkorn: SeeClickFix

Nailor: This is a parking lot issue for the future - send it to Ops for consideration in the future. You can plan on rolling out a maintenance plan in the future 

Marshia: If you can't do it now then don't. You don't have the info now.

Allen: This is kind of an internal performance measures

Marshia: Projects in VPINS will be mapped - OK. Maybe future large maintenance projects will be in VPINS

Nailor: Don't build a system around another data source - it will remove the impetus of OPS to build a sustainable database system

Filkorn: Leveling? - not included at the moment - should be? Give specific recomendations to program managers for how they can be included - change their behavior

Allen: Track threats and opportunities

511 vs VTP3 - there are many versions of the message right now

Filkorn: If THIS system is consistent, maybe it becomes centralized

Nailor: Identifying the "system of record" that carries the offical word

8:15am

#Day 3

7:30

Per Nailor:

Have the header of the popup mirror what people would want.

"If you are curious about construction in this area, call:"
"If you have a question about how this road is maintained, call:"
"If you work for a municipality and have questions about this road, call:"
Then send to Filkorn for comment

Scott: Should we include email addresses? Work with Bean and Craver to figure out why the Ops emails aren't in the ref table

Allen: When click, drop-down box with 3 pop-ups?


Matt:

Link as query string to open data portal

Viani: 

What are the themes for the homepage bins? The popout box should have a common theme

The top level shows a picture and title of the theme, then the popout will contain links to the different places

Scott: All data in GDB_VTrans is publishable under AGO ODP

#Day 4

7:30

New website - great!

Open data portal - Great! 

Marshia: Who is this for? You lost me

Nailor: This is an unintended benefit of this process 

Pavement data - old pavement proejcts is great.

Nailor: Can you show the town and route?

Scott: Why the OSM basemap?

Scott: Why routing?

Marshia: Show the routing.

Allen: Can you use the route as a selection set to display the condition of your routing?

Contact Map - popups have questions at the top

Most of the data was automated, but lacking info on email address for district contacts. Might not be sustainable.

Can it be from MATS?

Filkorn: We update the website manually

Nailor: Note down the issue so we can research a solution later.

Filkorn: How can we develop consistency across the agency. How can we simplify 

Marshia: Caputring a comprehensive parking lot is critical to the future. Things we highlight here for the future will be major targets for the agency. Not just "This is awesome" - "These are the things we know we should do. Force the agency to address the issues brought up. Prioritize them"

Viani: Bridges? Do we need condition?

Nailor: national interest in strucutral defficiency sometimes drive it

Scott: towns ask about bridges - summary reports, data etc from Thurber.

Filkorn: Where are the bridge inspection reports?

Marshia: The report is - "We want to show bridges, but we don't know how to display it" for discussion on Monday

Filkorn: Load limits would be dreamy. We get asked about load postings all the time. Different than the individual route permit

Nailor: List restrictions relevant to the public

Allen: Get the more detailed information available too for analysis

Scott: Restricted crane movement map was valuable. 

------

Data discussion:

Projects issue - be sure to bring up Monday so Marshia can put the pressure on to get project managers to input early start date

Contacts issue - there is not a good source of information
