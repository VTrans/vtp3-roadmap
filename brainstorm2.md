#We probably don't want to go with AGOL so we have a more flexible platform. The very best AGOL homepage doesn't quite meet our needs.

###Github Concerns

1. Spend too much time worrying about GitHub and lose track of the goals
2. It's more geared towards technical programming

###GitHub Benefits

1. We might not have to use it so much
2. One-stop documentation
3. For the future
