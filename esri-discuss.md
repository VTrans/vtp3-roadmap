#Feedback @ Esri
- Description column to go along with the attributes - metadata about each field name. "Data dictionary"
- No control on the ODP charts (style, sort, formatting)
  - Number of records limitation

#Feedback @ VTrans
- "Overwhelmingly positive feedback from Open Data team and others @ Esri"
- "Sprint is brilliant - it's tough to get alignment when people are separate. I wish more customers would do it."
- Turner - head of open data team - loved it
- Sharing the documentation was very helpful helping us understand your target
- Persistence in the ODP is a problem - we're working on it
- Dataset attributes - using dataset aliases
- Scroll bars on the images - something to work on?
- ODP charts for metrics - how is that working for you?
- ODP link is small - could it be more prominent?
  - Link from the map/app
